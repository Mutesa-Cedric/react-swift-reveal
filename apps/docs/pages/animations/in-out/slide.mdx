# Slide Animation

The **Slide** animation introduces a smooth sliding effect to elements, creating a visually appealing transition.

## Usage

To use the **Slide** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx
import { Slide } from "react-swift-reveal";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Slide>
      <div className="box">
        This element will slide as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Slide>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Props

The **Slide** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
