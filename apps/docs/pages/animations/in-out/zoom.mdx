# Zoom Animation

The **Zoom** animation adds a dynamic zoom-in effect to elements, creating an engaging visual transition.

## Usage

To use the **Zoom** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx filename="App.jsx" {3} copy
import { Zoom } from "react-swift-reveal";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Zoom>
      <div className="box">
        This element will zoom in as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Zoom>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Props

The **Zoom** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
