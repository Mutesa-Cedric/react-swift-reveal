# Rotate Animation

The **Rotate** animation brings a dynamic rotation effect to elements, adding a visually engaging transition.

## Usage

To use the **Rotate** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx filename="App.jsx" {3} copy
import { Rotate } from "react-swift-reveal";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Rotate>
      <div className="box">
        This element will rotate as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Rotate>
  );
};

export default App;
```

## Props

The **Rotate** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
