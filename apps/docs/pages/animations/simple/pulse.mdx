# Pulse Animation

The **Pulse** animation adds a subtle but attention-grabbing pulsing effect to elements, creating a visually engaging transition.

## Usage

To use the **Pulse** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx filename="App.jsx" {3} copy
import { Pulse } from 'react-swift-reveal';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Pulse>
      <div className="box">
        This element will pulse as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Pulse>
  );
};
```

## Props

The **Pulse** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
