# Jump Animation

The **Jump** animation adds a lively and dynamic jumping effect to elements, creating an engaging visual transition.

## Usage

To use the **Jump** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx
import { Jump } from 'react-swift-reveal';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Jump>
      <div className="box">
        This element will jump as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Jump>
  );
};
```

## Props

The **Jump** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
