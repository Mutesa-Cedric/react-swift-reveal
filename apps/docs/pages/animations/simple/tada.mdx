# Tada Animation

The **Tada** animation adds a playful and bouncy effect to elements, creating a visually engaging transition.

## Usage

To use the **Tada** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx filename="App.jsx" {3} copy
import { Tada } from 'react-swift-reveal';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Tada>
      <div className="box">
        This element will tada as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Tada>
  );
};
```

## Props

The **Tada** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
