# Spin Animation

The **Spin** animation adds a dynamic and rotating effect to elements, creating an engaging visual transition.

## Usage

To use the **Spin** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx
import { Spin } from 'react-swift-reveal';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Spin>
      <div className="box">
        This element will spin as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Spin>
  );
};
```

## Props

The **Spin** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
