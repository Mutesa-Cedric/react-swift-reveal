# Flash Animation

The **Flash** animation adds a quick, intense flash effect to elements, creating a dynamic visual impact.

## Usage

To use the **Flash** animation, import it from `react-swift-reveal`:

```jsx
import { Flash } from 'react-swift-reveal';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Flash>
      <div className="box">
        This element will flash as it enters the viewport.
      </div>
    </Flash>
  );
};
```

## Props

The **Flash** animation doesn't have any specific props, but it accepts all the props that are available to all animations. You can read more about them in the [Swift Reveal Props documentation](/animations/props/).
